# Top articles from a subreddit
I created a REST API that enables users to fetch the top articles from a specific subreddit.

The framework I used was Express with Node.js in the WebStorm IDE.
For testing I used the Jest Framework.
To view the output data body, I utilized a REST client called "Insomnia."
